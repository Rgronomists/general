# Rgronomists  
Rgronomists is an R user group for agronomists! We plan to start meeting in January of 2017. The objective of the group will be to bring together R users, or those interested in becoming R users, to discuss R in the context of research that involves soil, plants, the atmosphere, and/or the combination of these.  We will plan to meet for an hour each week.  This group is a follow up of [Data Stewardship for Earth Systems Scientists](http://agron590-isu.github.io).
